Indoor Navigation using Bluetooth Beacons <br>

Application uses Android Beacon Library <a href="https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library">https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library</a> 
to locate smartphone with installed app using bluetooth beacons. Uses trilateration algorithm (my implementation from explanation <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/884851">https://math.stackexchange.com/a/884851</a>)
and requires 3 configured beacons in the place
